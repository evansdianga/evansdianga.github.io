## Build this project

### Prerequisites
*
* If [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is not installed on your machine, install it. 
```bash
gem install jekyll
```
* Note [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a `Ruby` _`gem`_. So you need to have `Ruby` installed first.

### Install Node js Dependencies

* First install `gulp` globally
```bash
npm install -g gulp
```
* Run `npm install` in the root directory of the `evansdianga.github.io` files cloned or downloaded from `Github`.

### Running the Application Server

* Run `jekyll serve` in the root directory of the `evansdianga.github.io` files which spins up a development server with livereload as you make edits.
* *Note* If you make changes to `_config.yml` you will need to restart the server. This is a `Jekyll` limitation
